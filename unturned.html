    <p class="game_description">Unturned is an early access, survival-based zombie apocalypse themed game available for free on Steam. The game is developed by Smartly Dressed Games – a Canadian-based game developer (eh). In the game, whether it is on single player or on a server, your only goal is to survive, by any means necessary.<br><br>

Although the game may have simple graphics (think Minecraft style here) and generally easy controls, it is much more in-depth than it looks, giving a truly great experience to anybody that chooses to play. The game is??updated on a regular basis, with each update adding new features, factors and challenges to the multiplayer survival game.<br><br>




What do can you do in Unturned?<br><br>

In Unturned, you can do several different things on your own and with others.<br><br>

You can loot and plunder local towns, farms, campsites, airports and even military bases.
You can find a building to fortify or build your own.
You can find vehicles left behind to drive from town to town.
Most importantly, you can (and should always) search for weapons and ammo if you don’t have any.
On most servers, PvP (Player versus Player) is enabled, letting you fight for your life, or for the loot of dead bodies. Some servers enable you to reenact a Hunger Games situation and fight other players in a fast paced action scene.<br><br>

Or, if you prefer to take a break from all the servers, you can play in a single player world and build a base, find the best loot, and drive cars, boats, and fly helicopters and planes. In my personal experience, I have found that playing on a PvP server grants the best experience of the game because not only are you fighting other players, but also you are fighting your personal health, and zombies.<br><br>

The lists of possibilities go on, given that the game is an open world environment and Unturned is regularly improving its??reputation by adding new gear, vehicles, and some special items almost every week. </p>
